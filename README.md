## Is Height associated with First Serve speed in the Top 100 WTA players?
Serve is considered to be the most important skill in Tennis. In ATP, serves have been a huge component, with people with better serve ability tending to have a greater chance of winning. However, first-serve ability varies a lot between players in the WTA, and sometimes it is not consistent that the taller player has a more powerful serve, while the fastest servers tend to be taller. In this project, I attempt to investigate whether players’ height is statistically associated with first serve speed in the WTA top 100 players.  

- We scraped player information from the official WTA website, including ranking, age, and height. We supplemented these data with Tennis Abstract, which provided the number of aces, average first-serve speed, and preferred playing hand.
- The dataset includes the WTA Top 100 players as of February 16, with a mean age of 26.34 years (SD = 4.18). Match counts and ace totals reflect performance over the prior 52 weeks.
